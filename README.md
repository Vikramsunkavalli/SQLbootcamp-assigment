# SQLbootcamp-assigment
"Using SQL, create a database for a simple todo list program that has the following columns: task_id (primary key), task_name, description, and is_completed."
This statement creates a table named todo_list with four columns: task_id, task_name, description, and is_completed. 
The task_id column is specified as the primary key, ensuring each task has a unique identifier. 
The other columns hold the task name, description, and a boolean value indicating whether the task is completed (true) or not (false).
Like this we can create a to-do list.
